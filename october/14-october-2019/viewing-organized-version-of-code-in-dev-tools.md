# Viewing Organized Version of HTML Code in The Browser’s Dev Tools
1. Open up the dev tools, which is usually done with `command + I`.
2. Look at the “Elements” tab on the left along the top row. (In Firefox, it’s called “Inspectore”.)
3. If an element has a right-pointing arrow, the arrow can be clicked to reveal the element and its children. You may also walk the DOM tree with the arrow keys.
